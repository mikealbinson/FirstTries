<p>Ok so here's what I've been working on</p>

<h2> BarcodeIntegration </h2>
<p> Uses the BLE shield to read incoming messages from a phone through the RBL chat app  </p>

<h2> Beacon_send_receive </h2>
<p> Uses the RBL chat app to send out messages as a beacon and read incoming ticket codes </p>

<h2> CombinedFirstTries </h2>
<p> Combines BarcodeIntegration.ino and TicketConditionals.ino to show what the final code flow should look like (currently not working) </p>

<h2> TicketConditionals </h2>
<p> A switchcase flow of ticket conditions that can be used with the OLED </p>
</body>
